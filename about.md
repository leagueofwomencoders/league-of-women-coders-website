League of Women Coders is a grassroots collective that focusses on coding, hacking, and learning together. We're like a book club for superhero women coders. You'll find us championing free software, debating the best uses for ternary operators, defending against trolls, sharing what we know, and supporting each other in every way we can.

### Who should come?

Are you a woman* who loves programming and has been searching for a similar bunch of ladies to eat cupcakes and discuss code with? Are you happier discussing Ruby** than rubies over coffee? If so, you’ve come to the right place!

*If you call yourself a woman, we do too! We don't care what's in your genes OR your jeans. Unless you're a robot, then we very much care and want you to join right away so we can pick your brain or... motherboard.

**Or Python, Java, C, Perl, Haskell, Bash, PHP, Coq — we're language-agnostic!

### What are your meetups like?

We meet at least once a month to hack on projects, give casual 5-minute lightning talks, ask all of our technical questions, and toss around ideas together. It's a great way to make new friends, and to bounce ideas off each other to keep improving our coding skills. We usually have tasty treats of the baked variety and pizza for all of your om-ing and nom-ing needs. We also love to bring in interesting lady speakers, so let us know if you have anything you'd like to hear or talk about!

### What if I don’t code?

We are going to be discussing some pretty in-depth, geeky stuff. If you are not deterred by that and are still really excited about coming, you’re more than welcome. A lot of us are more than happy to pay forward all the help we've received along the way, and give you any advice or pointers (pun intended) you might be looking for!

### Where can I go to learn to code?

Our friends over at [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/) host excellent classes for folks who just getting started.

### Do I have to be a woman?

Yes. If you are a man who is interested in supporting women in tech, please send us a message directly and we'll be happy to provide some other suggestions.

### Do you take donations?

Nope. We do this out of love for our community of lady geeks and we think money only complicates things. No money will ever be exchanged here, by anyone. We do encourage you to volunteer your time at any local organizations that support underrepresented groups in tech or contribute to open source projects.
